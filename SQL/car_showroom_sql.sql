# Main business points:

## 1) Extract information that you consider valuable for the business and represent with this at least 3 descriptive visualisations. 
#
#2) Find the total number of employees the company has and display a visualisation in Tableau showing the staff per country.
# 
#3) Find two appropriate variables from different tables and extract the information to perform a linear regression model with that data identifying possible relationship between the variables 
# (you can use Python or Excel to achieve this point). Explain the outcome and visualise the data using Tableau or Python.
# 
#4) Use an appropriate visualisation in Tableau to show the stock available per line of products.
#
#5) Use an appropriate visualisation to show the current orderâ€™s status. 
#
#6) Find out the nationalities that are buying the cars in the different offices. Visualise this in Tableau showing the proportion per nationality in each showroom.
# 
#7) Benchmarking is a common strategy in business to compare business processes and performance metrics. Use your data and try this strategy comparing the performance of this business with other car showrooms.

# Introduction:

# The roots of diecast modelling go back to 1900 when the first models were made from tinplate, not long after the original cars were made, and their targeted audience was children of wealthy parents. 
# After World War I, companies such as Citroen continued to make tinplate models with the purpose of promoting their cars within 1:8 and 1:11 scales. 
# In later years, diecast companies introduced models made from zinc alloy to the market, of which production was cheaper than tinplate models.
# In the 1960s, diecast manufacturers introduced models with a scale of 1:43 by European companies, of which models became much more authentic copies of the original cars. 
# The model parts started to become more detailed as well. Some of the examples were opening doors, wheels made from rubber, or detailed interiors.
# With further development of model details, many adult collectors became interested in diecast modelling; therefore, new shops have been opened, specialising in producing car models made from resin or handmade from white metal, with the ability to make orders by mail. 
# The model scales such as 1:43 and 1:18 became the most popular due to their sizes and high degree of detail, therefore, the value of such models also started to increase significantly.
